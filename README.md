Free Code Camp  - Taipei community project 1.0
__________________________________________

This is a community project by members of Free Code Camp, Taipei. The objective of this project is for all team members to gain experience working in a collaborative environment with github.
We will be creating a simple webapp which has a one page user interface page.
The page can accept text which is then submitted to the server and stored in a mongodb database.  Each message that has been submitted will be echoed on the page immediately after submission along with all previous messages.

This app will use passport.js for authentication: http://passportjs.org/
We will be following the clementine.js boilerplate tutorial closely in developing our server and client side.

As we progress with this project we will upgrade it into a fully functional community site, using as few outside frameworks as we can to build as much as we can ourselves.
